The code titled "Analysis of New York City's Flood Vulnerability Index" performs a detailed analysis of flood vulnerability across different scenarios in New York City. It processes flood vulnerability data, visualizes the spatial distribution of flood risks, and evaluates the impact of socio-economic factors on flood vulnerability. The report aims to guide flood resilience policies by assessing the Flood Vulnerability Index (FVI) across six scenarios, including current and future storm surge and tidal flooding. The study reveals that low-income neighborhoods are disproportionately affected by future storm surge scenarios, underscoring the need for targeted resilience programs. Statistical analysis confirms significant disparities in vulnerability across socio-economic groups, highlighting the critical role of socio-economic factors in flood risk management.
